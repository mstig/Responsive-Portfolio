                I am currently a student in University of Richmond's full stack web development program. Seeking employment in web development
                after graduation in October 2018. I have prior coding experience in Java and strong technical skills, and
                have built multiple computers myself.

            <p>
                I am a huge fan of music in almost all forms, both listening and playing. I primarily play bass guitar and electric guitar,
                and am currently learning how to play piano! I also played clarinet and trombone for middle and high school
                band. I love everything involving rock and roll, from classic rock to the modern era. As a bassist, I also
                love anything with a funky beat!
            </p>

            <p>
                I love sports in any form, I am a former member and team captain of the VCU Men's Rugby Team and a fan of the NFL's Washington
                Redskins. I played soccer in my youth and currently play squash and rec kickball in my spare time.
